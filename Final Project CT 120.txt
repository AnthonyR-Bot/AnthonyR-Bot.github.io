Final Project Proposal


I will be making a twine game that’s relatively the same length as the one I turned in on May 5 for the choose your website assignment. My plan is to add a bit more code into the game besides adding branching pathways.
The main big thing would be an inventory system as well as parts of the game where you need something in your inventory for you to be unlocked. 


Plot
The game is a simple story about trying to find keys to unlock a safehouse out on a quiet street. It will be in the same text game except you know exactly what to do with the objective popping up in your inventory.


Basic Features
1. Inventory system
2. If statements to check if you have something
3. A simple ending that resets the game upon clicking restart. 
4. Collectibles in the form of Lore tidbits of the world
5. Using html to do visual effects




Documentation:
 I began documentation as I have a layout of how I want the game to be and feel. I’ll start uploading prototypes of features for the beginning of next week before bug fixing and finishing up the game in late week 9 and 10.
